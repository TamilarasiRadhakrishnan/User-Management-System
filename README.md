API Reference
This project uses the JSONPlaceholder API.

Get Users: GET /users
Add User: POST /users
Edit User: PUT /users/:id
Delete User: DELETE /users/:id
Known Issues
Changes are not persisted in the API since JSONPlaceholder is a mock API.
Validation is minimal for the form fields (only required fields).
Future Enhancements
Add client-side validation using libraries like Yup.
Implement pagination or infinite scrolling.
Use a persistent backend instead of a mock API.
